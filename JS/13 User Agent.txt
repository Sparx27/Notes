Most Web browsers use a User-Agent string value as follows:
Mozilla/[version] ([system and browser information]) [platform] ([platform details]) [extensions].

Mozilla is a byproduct of browser wars.

AppleWebKit/537.36 is the platform used by your browser.

Chrome/51.0.2704.63 is your browser

Safari/537.36 was added for historic reasons, where Safari was treated differently.
